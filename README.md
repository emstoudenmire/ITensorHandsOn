## Running the scripts
When you are running the scripts, make sure you pick up the required packages by activating and instantiating the `codes` environment.
This can be done with the following lines of code
```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.activate("/path/to/codes")
julia> Pkg.instantiate()
```
When finished compiling, all the scripts will be ready to run.
